Hi!

My name’s Brend. I’ve just joined the graphics department as an Adobe
specialist.

I’ll be getting in touch with influencers, bloggs and vloggs to increase our online presence.

If you see a new face around, well, that’s me :) We can chat about cyberpunk literature, video games,
and downhill mountain biking.

Cheers!
Brend

PS The sweat treats in the kitchen are all for you!
